### Post Title: "How I Saved $2,500 on Building Permit Floor Plans Using AI"

**Introduction:**
Last month, I needed professional floor plans for a building permit. Every architect quoted me $2,000-$3,500 and said it would take 3-4 weeks. Then I discovered AI Floor Plan Designer.

**The Problem:**
Building permits require detailed floor plans showing existing and proposed layouts. Traditional options are expensive and slow.

**The Solution:**
AI Floor Plan Designer generates professional floor plans from simple text descriptions in seconds.

**My Results:**
- Time: 20 minutes (vs 3-4 weeks)
- Cost: $0 (vs $2,500)
- Outcome: Permit approved first try

**How It Works:**
1. Describe your floor plan in plain English
2. AI generates professional layout
3. Export and submit to building department

**Conclusion:**
AI has democratized professional design. Anyone can now create permit-quality floor plans without expensive software or architect fees.
